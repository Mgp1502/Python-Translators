Sometimes it can be helpful to "mold" the context. A few of those reasons can be:

- Reduce the context to make translations cheaper.
- Remove words that "confuse" translation services to increase accuracy
- Mutate the context purely for the sake of changing the context to hopefully end up with different translations.
