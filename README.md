## Python translators

This library contains a few wrappers for translation services. Aside from a simple translator powered by the Glosbe API,
the Google Translator comes with an additional feature: context aware translations. Rather than just passing it a phrase
you want to translate, you can also pass the context in which the phrase occurred and the translation will take this into
account.

# Installation
